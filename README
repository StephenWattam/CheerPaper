Cheerpaper is a program to set your desktop according to colours dispensed by
the Cheerlights service ( http://cheerlights.com ).

It does this by polling the web service and finding files within a specific
directory that match the pattern given.  It then shells out to a pre-defined
call of your choice to actually set the wallpaper, meaning that it's actually
capable of doing things other than set wallpaper ;-).



                                -- Usage --

Simply put the script somewhere in your $PATH and call it with the -h flag to
get some help.

Basic usage methods are as follows:

  1) Set wallpaper without polling:
      
      $ cheerpaper -d /path/to/wallpapers -o

  2) Poll at regular (60s) intervals, setting the wallpaper when it changes:
     
      $ cheerpaper -d /path/to/wallpapers -i 60

By default, cheerpaper drops to the background and drops a pid file in /tmp/ so
that it can reside as a system service.



                        -- Wallpaper Setting Policy --

Cheerpaper will look through the directory given for suitable wallpapers: these
must begin with the data sampled from the web service, and must end with one of
the extensions listed (can be set with -e).

If multiple files match these criteria, cheerpaper will select a random one.
Note that your desktop will not get randomised every time, only when the colour
changes (else fast polling intervals would make it unusable.)
